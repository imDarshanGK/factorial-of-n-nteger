# factorial-of-n-nteger
factorial of n integer

Problem Description:

The program takes a number and finds the factorial of that number without using recursion.

Program Explanation:

1} User must enter a number.

2} A factorial variable is initialized to 1.

3} A for loop is used to multiply the number to the factorial variable and then the number is decremented each time.

4} This continues till the value of the number is greater than 0.

5} The factorial of the number is printed.

Example 1:

Enter a number:10
